The ML project 


This is a Machine Learning project based on Supervised Learning having nearly about 80% accuracy score.
To run this code just load this files to your preffered environment and install required dependencies and in terminal run "streamlit run app.py" this command.

Since i have used Supervised leraning algorithms and among that all KNN had given more accuracy so it is based on KNN and frontend is created using streamlit.
